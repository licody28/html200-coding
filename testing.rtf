\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Testing of Adopt a Dog:\
\
1. Browsers used:
\f1\i\b0 \ulnone \

\f2\i0 -Microsoft Edge\
-Firefox\
-Safari\
\
\ul Results:\
\ulnone Between the 3 browsers, the website generally seemed the same in terms of\
where the content had been laid out and functioning prior in google chrome. \
The only slight disparity noticed between one another was maybe slight difference\
in spacing and/or location of the content - whether the element was shift slightly more\
in one direction or not.\
\

\f0\b \ul 2. Operating systems used:\

\f2\b0 \ulnone -Macbook\
-Windows\
\
\ul Results:\
\ulnone The dog tiles were formatted properly and appeared just like the mockup PDF, but\
when viewed on the windows PC - they were a lot wider and completely different.\
Not sure if this was because the monitor screen on the PC was a lot wider than my \
Macbook had to do with that or not.\
\

\f0\b \ul 3. Devices:
\f2\b0 \ulnone \
-Apple iPhone X\
\
\ul Results:\
\ulnone Website layout was zoomed out and content seemed to be stretched in some areas at\
first, then created a media query that allowed for better resizing and viewing of the content\
for mobile devices. However, changed the way it was viewed on Desktop, certain elements\
were being displaced in the wrong areas - temporarily commenting out the media querys\
to see what\'92s wrong.}
